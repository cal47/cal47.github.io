    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The week in review.</h2>

<p>I considered this week to be pretty fast paced and I realized that I was less prepared for class than I thought I was.  It was a wake up call.  I think that my code writing is about the middle of the pack at this point.  I know how to solve the problems conceptually but I don&rsquo;t know how to manipulate the code well enough yet.  I&rsquo;m struggling a bit with string &amp; array manipulation right now.  I just have to brute force my way through it and keep doing the TestFirst exercises until I grok it.</p>

<p>Having said that I like the pace.  It&rsquo;s fast and challenging and that keeps me motivated and makes me competitive within myself.  I really liked the pair programming exercise and I think that Eric and I worked well together.  I felt that he understands the language better than I did, while I understood how the parts should fit together better than he did.</p>

<p>Now about the coffee situation&hellip;</p>
