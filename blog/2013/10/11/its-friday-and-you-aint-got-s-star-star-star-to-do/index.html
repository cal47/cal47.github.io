<div class="entry-content"><p>That is (obvi) a quote from the movie &ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; when Chris Tucker comes by Ice Cube&rsquo;s house after Cube has been fired.  Now for me it&rsquo;s also Friday but I have a lot of s*** to do.  Let&rsquo;s start by revisiting the past and go over my last week @ Fullstack.  It flat out sucked. I had zero energy, I could not concentrate on anything I could not focus and I was falling asleep during the lectures.  By the end of the week I was frustrated at myself and questioning why I had even bothered to sign up for this. So last Friday rolls around and I decide that perhaps a lot of sleep would provide me with a reset and get me back on track.  I woke up Saturday morning and still felt like complete dog dookie.  I moped around for most of the day and at around 5 PM I visited my gf&rsquo;s business to help her with some computer stuff.  Now my girlfriend owns a massage therapy business and when i complained of a headach she offered to give me a neck rub. This neck rub literally changed my life.  It turns out all my lack of focus and loss of energy was because I was carrying all my tension in my neck and this had severe nuerological consequences such as my incredible lack of focus and everything else I listed above.  Frankly I&rsquo;m still shocked at the difference a massage made.  I feel like I lost a valuable week last week.</p>

<p>So when I started this week, I immediately felt 100% better than I did all of last week.  I was alert, I could focus, I cared a lot more&hellip; everything was improved. As the week progressed I made up for some of the lost ground.  I am amazed at the difference in progress I&rsquo;ve made this week compared to last.  Moving forward I expect to maintain this momentum and accelerate my learning.</p>

<p>At a high level, I understand the MVC patterns of Rails and I can see how they come together. It was a considerable context shift from straight Ruby but the lessons this week made the transition much easier.  I actually really liked the progression we made through rails this week and rebuilding stackworld on rails was a great idea for educational purposes.  It really helped crystalize how rails works.  I only wish there was a more visual way of seeing how all the parts fit together.</p>

<p>I found that I was doing the Stackworld in rails mostly solo and I liked it.  I actually restarted the project at some point b/c of environment issues and it really helped me to understand it b/c I could see the MVC patterns more clearly than I would have been able to working with a partner.  I like working on team but not until I have a good foundational understanding of the concepts that I&rsquo;m working with.</p>

<p>I approached this assessment from the wrong perspective.  I did not study a lot and now I&rsquo;m regretting that decision.  Sigh&hellip;</p>
