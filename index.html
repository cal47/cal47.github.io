  <div class="entry-content"><p>First project working with Rails and I like it.  I like working frameworks and logical constructs and this project was a very good first experience with this technology.  It really crystallized how the MVC works and got me familiar with all the many different parts of a Rails app.  One of the things about Rails that I didn&rsquo;t really realize until this week was how critical the routes are to the application.  I conceptually understood that they generated sql but I didn&rsquo;t really get how all the helper methods were created until this project.  I still don&rsquo;t fully understand it but at least I know how to use it.  I&rsquo;m thinking back to the simple record project and I did not have the context or understanding of Rails OR Ruby to appreciate what we were doing at the time.  It may be a project that I revisit now that I&rsquo;ve used Rails.</p>

<p>With regards to the Rails framework as a whole, I want to see what&rsquo;s going on via a reference tool or document that is dynamically generated like rake routs and the schema.rb file is.  I suppose this is the discomfort of a novice and when I am more familiar with how Rails operates, it will become fast knowledge.  I am also making the transition from working with packaged software to generating original software.  I&rsquo;m going from configuring pre-built components to taking raw coding material and making something.  This transition is uncomfortable and challenging because I am beyond my comfort zone.  But you don&rsquo;t grow or learn by being comfortable.  Too much comfort just makes you fat and sleepy.</p>

<p>I do like working in teams but I feel like i missed out on learning how to implement certain components (like stripe and implementing user roles) as a result of this. On the flipside I was able to focus on generating most of the routes, hierarchy and ownership and get some core concepts grounded.  Overall, our team was effective and functional.  When we had issues, the person responsilbe was identified in constructive way and we ususally had a good laugh about it to lighten the mood.  Everyone worked really hard and we all learned a ton.  I feel good about this project and the progress I&rsquo;ve made,  however it also made me realize how much I don&rsquo;t know.  I&rsquo;ll be spending a lot of time this weekend playing with rails and reviewing ruby fundamentals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That is (obvi) a quote from the movie &ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; when Chris Tucker comes by Ice Cube&rsquo;s house after Cube has been fired.  Now for me it&rsquo;s also Friday but I have a lot of s*** to do.  Let&rsquo;s start by revisiting the past and go over my last week @ Fullstack.  It flat out sucked. I had zero energy, I could not concentrate on anything I could not focus and I was falling asleep during the lectures.  By the end of the week I was frustrated at myself and questioning why I had even bothered to sign up for this. So last Friday rolls around and I decide that perhaps a lot of sleep would provide me with a reset and get me back on track.  I woke up Saturday morning and still felt like complete dog dookie.  I moped around for most of the day and at around 5 PM I visited my gf&rsquo;s business to help her with some computer stuff.  Now my girlfriend owns a massage therapy business and when i complained of a headach she offered to give me a neck rub. This neck rub literally changed my life.  It turns out all my lack of focus and loss of energy was because I was carrying all my tension in my neck and this had severe nuerological consequences such as my incredible lack of focus and everything else I listed above.  Frankly I&rsquo;m still shocked at the difference a massage made.  I feel like I lost a valuable week last week.</p>

<p>So when I started this week, I immediately felt 100% better than I did all of last week.  I was alert, I could focus, I cared a lot more&hellip; everything was improved. As the week progressed I made up for some of the lost ground.  I am amazed at the difference in progress I&rsquo;ve made this week compared to last.  Moving forward I expect to maintain this momentum and accelerate my learning.</p>

<p>At a high level, I understand the MVC patterns of Rails and I can see how they come together. It was a considerable context shift from straight Ruby but the lessons this week made the transition much easier.  I actually really liked the progression we made through rails this week and rebuilding stackworld on rails was a great idea for educational purposes.  It really helped crystalize how rails works.  I only wish there was a more visual way of seeing how all the parts fit together.</p>

<p>I found that I was doing the Stackworld in rails mostly solo and I liked it.  I actually restarted the project at some point b/c of environment issues and it really helped me to understand it b/c I could see the MVC patterns more clearly than I would have been able to working with a partner.  I like working on team but not until I have a good foundational understanding of the concepts that I&rsquo;m working with.</p>

<p>I approached this assessment from the wrong perspective.  I did not study a lot and now I&rsquo;m regretting that decision.  Sigh&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know that I&rsquo;m making progress and I&rsquo;m enjoying the process but I&rsquo;m starting to get stressed about finding the right job opportunity.  So this morning, on my commute in, I watched a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend.html?utm_source=email&amp;source=email&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=ios-share">Ted talk about stress</a> that made me feel better.  If you watch this, watch it to the very end.  The presenter is asked a question from a moderator (why Ted Talks need moderators&hellip;) and she has an excellent response.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been a student in a long, long time and I&rsquo;m finding it to be both fun and difficult!  I am not used to concentrating on learning for so long.  I&rsquo;m very good at being a top level thinker and seeing how different parts are put together, interact with each other, interact with users and how everything flows together.  However I&rsquo;m not [YET] very good at programming and it&rsquo;s somewhat frustrating.  I know the steps I would take to get from point A to point B, but I&rsquo;m so unfamiliar with how the technology works and still too inept at stringing together syntax to quickly or easily make my programs do what I want them to do.  I feel that in terms of my proficiency I&rsquo;m about in the middle of the pack but I have no way to gauge my progress relative to any &ldquo;norm.&rdquo;  I would like to know what I should be able to do at certain points as we progress through the program.  Like after the stackworld exercise (which was awesome btw, as it grounded how web applications are created and maintained through a tangible project), what should I be able to accomplish on my own at the end of this project?  I guess I feel that I&rsquo;m not progressing as fast as I should be.  More accurately, I&rsquo;m not progressing as fast as I want to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hard to believe that it&rsquo;s only been 2 weeks.  Feels more like 2 months. The pace is fast and it&rsquo;s been like drinking from a firehouse but I&rsquo;m making more and more connections.  I think the freeform nature of the projects is a good thing but it&rsquo;s challenging.  I feel like i&rsquo;m always trying to catch up and as soon as I understand and can implement a concept, something new and more difficult lands on my lap.  So I&rsquo;m constantly uncomfortable and struggling.  I think this is good.  I haven&rsquo;t been challenged or interested or interested in what&rsquo;s been challenging me in a good long while.</p>

<p>Having just walked out of our weekly group meeting I strongly agree with having some time to regroup and reinforce the concepts we&rsquo;ve learned by working alone.</p>

<p>My struggles are primarily language based &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how to tell the computer what I want it to do very well.  I know exactly how I want something to work and I have a very strong high level understanding of how to solve problems and how the pieces should be put together but I&rsquo;m still weak in stringing together a list of commands and getting the syntax right. I&rsquo;ve started reading the Ruby Monk tutorial and I am finding it to be great at reinforcing concepts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The week in review.</h2>

<p>I considered this week to be pretty fast paced and I realized that I was less prepared for class than I thought I was.  It was a wake up call.  I think that my code writing is about the middle of the pack at this point.  I know how to solve the problems conceptually but I don&rsquo;t know how to manipulate the code well enough yet.  I&rsquo;m struggling a bit with string &amp; array manipulation right now.  I just have to brute force my way through it and keep doing the TestFirst exercises until I grok it.</p>

<p>Having said that I like the pace.  It&rsquo;s fast and challenging and that keeps me motivated and makes me competitive within myself.  I really liked the pair programming exercise and I think that Eric and I worked well together.  I felt that he understands the language better than I did, while I understood how the parts should fit together better than he did.</p>

<p>Now about the coffee situation&hellip;</p>
